        "author_description": "Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, was a spiritual teacher who founded Buddhism. His journey to enlightenment began in ancient India, around the 5th century BCE. Born into a royal family, Siddhartha lived a life of luxury until he encountered the harsh realities of life outside the palace. These encounters with old age, sickness, and death deeply troubled him and set him on a quest for understanding and inner peace. At the age of 29, Siddhartha renounced his royal privileges and embarked on a spiritual journey. He practiced severe asceticism, seeking spiritual awakening through extreme self-denial. However, he eventually realized that neither the indulgent life of the palace nor the severe ascetic practices were the path to enlightenment. Instead, he discovered the Middle Wayâ€”a path of moderation and balance.",
